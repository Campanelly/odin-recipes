# odin-recipes
First Odin Project.
I will build an online recipe book, using the HTML concepts that i've learned so far: lists, links, images, and basic html text. The recipe-book will be in spanish, because is my native language, and i'll be writing down actual recipes from my "analog" recipe book.
